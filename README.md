# VisualAnalytics-NetflixData

The aim of the project is to Create two or more graphics that relate to your field of study and explain their design choices for their charts and graphs: aesthetics, color choice, chart type, and what design elements convey to the viewer

For this part I have taken Netflix Dataset.
Netflix is one of the internet streaming services, worldwide. Here I have taken dataset from Kaggle, with 12 columns, including show_id, titles, years, release country, ratings, genre, type, and genre. Each column gives whether it belongs to movie type or Web Series aka TV shows type. The data is historic data from 1959, though Netflix started the streaming service late, it had initially displayed the old movies and TV shows, before producing itself.
Here is the timeline of Netflix, it shows when it first started as Mail service, then moving forward with time it started the streaming service. This is an overview of the lifecycle which is still in progress. I used Canva to create this timeline diagram.
And used python to create different other visualization using Netflix color pallete.
